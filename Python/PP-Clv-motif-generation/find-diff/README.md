Compare and combine two fasta lists -- currently hardcoded, but can be altered.
```python find-diffs.py Example-input/genbank-kobu.fasta Example-input/vipr-kobu.fasta all```

## Example stdout
"# of unique entries for genbank:  53"
"# of unique entries for vipr:  2"
"# of shared entries:  144"
"# of shared entries by fasta:  144"
"# of combined entries returned 199"
